With the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the water, commenced a portage of as many miles, which conducted the adventurer to the banks of the Hudson, at a point where, with the usual obstructions of the rapids, or rifts, as they were then termed in the language of the country, the river became navigable to the tide.?</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: none; line-height: 22.390625px; box-shadow: none; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\"><img src=\"http://imperavi.com/img/redactor-image.jpg\" width=\"685\" height=\"287\" data-verified=\"redactor\" data-save-url=\"/img/redactor-image.jpg\" rel=\"width: 685px; height: 287px;\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; outline: 0px; background-color: transparent; max-width: 100%; height: 287px; width: 685px;\"></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: none; line-height: 22.390625px; box-shadow: none; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\">\"Come,\" he said, with a good-humored smile; \"the buck that will take to the water must be headed, and not followed.\"</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; padding: 0px; border: none; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: none; line-height: 22.390625px; box-shadow: none; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\">The route taken by Hawkeye lay across those sandy plains, relived by occasional valleys and swells of land, which had been traversed by their party on the morning of the same day, with the baffled Magua for their guide.
